<h1>The best movies according to Aleksandre</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>An absolute masterpiece, a work of art.</p>
<h3>Prisoners</h3>
<p>A hidden gem of a movie. Very underrated. Loved Hugh Jackmans' and Jake Gyllenhaals' performances.</p>
<h3>Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
<p>Now, I know this one might stick out like a sore thumb in comparison to the other two movies on this list in terms of writing and depth, but the vibe it gave off, and the sheer excitement it garnered from me, and from millions of others probably, will always be unmatched and unforgotten.
That is why, in my opinion, it deserves to be on this list.
